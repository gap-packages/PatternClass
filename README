The 'PatternClass' GAP 4 package
================================

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! Patch info !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We had to patch the IntersectionAutomaton, UnionAutomata and ProductLanguage 
from the Automata pkg (version 1.13) to improve performance testing. The 
patched functions are located in lib/aux.* .

Introduction
------------

This is version 1.12358132134 of the 'PatternClass' package.

The 'PatternClass' package allows you to explore the permutation
pattern classes build by token passing networks.
Amongst other things, 'PatternClass' can compute the basis of a
permutation pattern class et vice versa, rank encode and decode permutations,
create automata from token passing networks and checking if the
deterministic automaton is a possible representative of a 
token passing network.
More details on what functions "PatternClass' contains, consult
the manual in the doc folder.

If there are any problems with the package please do not hesitate to contact us.

This package comes with the following files and directories

    doc             the directory with the manual
    init.g          this file does initialise the package
    lib             this directory contains all GAP code
    lib/grid        this directory contains experimental code which is not preloaded
                    see README in lib/grid for info
    PackageInfo.g   the information file for automatic processing
    read.g          this file reads the package
    README          you are currently reading this file

Unpacking and Installing 'PatternClass'
---------------------------------------

If you get 'PatternClass' as a compressed file unpack it in the pkg/ folder
in the gap4r4 folder where GAP is installed on your computer.
To uncompress the .tar.gz file on UNIX use the following command

   tar xzf PatternClass1.12358132134.tar.gz

If your version of tar does not support the z option use

   gunzip PatternClass1.12358132134.tar.gz
   tar xf PatternClass1.12358132134.tar

This will create the folder PatternClass in pkg/ and within that
you will find the directories and files mentioned above.

To use the package within GAP, run GAP and type the following

gap> LoadPackage("PatternClass");
----------------------------------------------------------------
Loading  PatternClass 1.12358132134
For help, type: ?PatternClass: 
----------------------------------------------------------------
true
gap> 

Now you can use all functions of 'PatternClass' within this session
of GAP. As described in the manual, found in the doc directory or 
online or within GAP help.

<<<>>><<<>>><<<>>><<<>>>

Changes from 1.1 to 1.12:

- The following functions have been added: 
   * IsInterval - Checker whether the input sequence is an interval.
   * Inflation - Returns a permutation that is represented by the
      input list of permutations.
   * Block-Decomposition - Returns the unique (for some permutations)
      list of permutations representing the input permutation in a
      truncated format.

<<<>>><<<>>><<<>>><<<>>>

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1:

- Improvement in BoundedClassAutomaton

- Additional functions checking whether a permutation is
   * plus-decomposable
   * minus-decomposable
   * simple

- Functions to build the rational subsets of a class accepting
  all plus- (minus-) decomposable permutations (also indecomposable 
  permutations)

- Functions to check whether the input list is 
   * a valid rank encoding
   * a rank encoding stemming from the input class

- A function calculating the complement of a permutation

- Functions to calculate the direct sum or the skew sum of 2 permutations

- A function calculating the direct sum for 2 rational pattern classes

- A function to build the automaton that accepts all permutations under the
  rank encoding that have the same number of inversions.

- A function that builds the subclass containing all permutations with the
  same number of inversions in the class.
